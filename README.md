# Borice.genomic
The programs have been tested in python 2.7 and are dependent on SciPy.


ï»¿The two program files (Borice.genomic.dt1.py and Borice.genomic.dt2.py) were written in Python 2.7 (http://www.python.org/) and tested using the Linux operating system.  If libraries are accessible, the programs should run using Python 2.7 in Windows or Mac operating systems.  The command line usages: </p>
python Borice.genomic.dt1.py </p>
python Borice.genomic.dt2.py
