The two program files (Borice.genomic.dt1.py and Borice.genomic.dt2.py) were written in Python 2.7 (http://www.python.org/) and tested using the Linux operating system.  If libraries are accessible, the programs should run using Python 2.7 in Windows or Mac operating systems.  The command line usages:
python Borice.genomic.dt1.py 
python Borice.genomic.dt2.py

Key parameters, such as names of input genotype file, are indentified in Control.txt
